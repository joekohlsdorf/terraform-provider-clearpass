## [v0.0.10] - UNRELEASED

### Added
- Added resource for Admin Privilege (`clearpass_admin_privilege`).
- Added data sources for Admin Privilege (`clearpass_admin_privilege`, `clearpass_admin_privileges`).
- Added data sources for Network Devices (`clearpass_network_devices`).
- Added data sources for Network Device Groups (`clearpass_network_device_groups`).

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where `clearpass_network_device` would return an inconsistent result error when `onconnect_enforcement` was configured as disabled.
- Fixed `clearpass_auth_method` import leaving `details` out of state, which made the first plan after an import propose an update with every field as "known after apply". `details` is now refreshed from the API on every read.

### Changed
- Updated acceptance tests to address parameter validation and syntax issues.
- **Breaking:** `clearpass_auth_method` `details` is now a nested attribute instead of a block. Configurations must change `details { ... }` to `details = { ... }`. Existing state is upgraded automatically from schema version 0 to 1.

### Notes
- Updated provider internal dependencies.
